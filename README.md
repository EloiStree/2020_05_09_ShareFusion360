# Hello there :) !

Welcome to you in this repository.
Since I bought a CNC I started to do a huge amout of 3D projects.

As my philosophy is to alway let access openly on my project.
Here you can a find my offline save of my Fusion 360 project.

Feel free to use them for non-commercial reason.

If you want to use them for commercial reason I invite you to buy a license here:

I plan to publish them on a store to a symbolic 1‚Ç¨ for people that don't want to buy a full license.
In any case feel free to support my work with ‚òï or üç∫ on https://ko-fi.com/eloistree


Hope it helps.
Kind regards, 
Eloi
